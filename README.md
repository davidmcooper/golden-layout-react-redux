# golden-layout-react-redux-router

## Install
```bash
npm install
```

## Run
```bash
npm start
```

Minimal example showing how to link redux state to react components embedded within golden-layout while using connected-react-router
Still not entirely working.


Notes:

In node_modules/golden-layout/dist/goldenlayout.js need to comment-out

`
with( area )
`

and

`
with( header )
`
